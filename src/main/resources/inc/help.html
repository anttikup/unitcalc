  <h3>Symbols</h3>
  <p>
    You can always use the full name of a unit by quoting it.
  </p>
  <p class="code">
    2 "foot" + 3 "millimetre"
  </p>
  <p>
    To define a symbol for the unit, set the full name as the value of a variable.
  </p>
  <p class="code">
    cm = "centimetre"
  </p>

  <h3>Operators</h3>
  <p>
    Supported operators: <span class="op">+</span>, <span class="op">−</span>, <span class="op">·</span> (or <span class="op">*</span>), <span class="op">/</span>, and <span class="op">^</span> (exponentiation).
  </p>
  <p>
    Space is also regarded as multiplication. It differs from <span class="op">·</span> in that it binds more thightly than <span class="op">/</span>. So, <span class="code">5 m / 3 s</span> means <span class="code">(5 · m) / (3 · s)</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Function-like operators: <span class="op">sqrt</span> (square root), <span class="op">cbrt</span> (cube root).
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use <span class="op">?</span> to get the result in given unit.
  </p>
  <p class="code">
    22 cm / 93 ms ? m/s
  </p>
  <p>
    Use <span class="op">=</span> to set variables.
  </p>
  <p class="code">
    length = 9 cm + 3 in
  </p>
  <p>
    Special variable <span class="op">_</span> always holds the last result.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use semicolon (<span class="op">;</span>) to separate expressions.
  </p>
  <p class="code">
    cm = "centimetre"; mm = "millimetre"; km = "kilometre"
  </p>
