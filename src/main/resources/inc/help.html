  <h3>Operators</h3>
  <p>
    Supported operators: <span class="op">+</span>, <span class="op">−</span>, <span class="op">·</span> (or <span class="op">*</span>), <span class="op">/</span>, and <span class="op">^</span> (exponentiation).
  </p>
  <p>
    Space is also regarded as multiplication. It differs from <span class="op">·</span> in that it binds more thightly than <span class="op">/</span>. So, <span class="code">5 m / 3 s</span> means <span class="code">(5 · m) / (3 · s)</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Function-like operators: <span class="op">sqrt</span> (square root), <span class="op">cbrt</span> (cube root).
  </p>
  <h3>Symbols</h3>
  <p>
    To use a unit you must define a symbol for it. Currently there are only SI units. Symbols for base units (<span class="op">m</span>, <span class="op">s</span>, ...) are defined by default, and symbols for other multiples must be defined separately. To define a symbol for a unit:
  </p>
  <p class="code">
    cm: centimetre
  </p>
  <p>
    Multiple definitions:
  </p>
  <p class="code">
    cm: centimetre; mm: millimetre; km: kilometre
  </p>
